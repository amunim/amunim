- 👋 Hi, I’m @amunim
- 👀 I’m mostly interested in .Net framwork

I'm currently working on https://sunspotvacationrentals.com/ and its linked websites(like goldenerinns.com), redesigning the UI also migrating from classic asp(VB) to Asp .net MVC and using Next.js for server side rendering and to create UI with react components. Big fan of `Mytested.AspNetCore.MVC` for testing(the framework does not require to "mock" everything which makes it an ideal choice for projects) and follow CQRS pattern(`Mediator`). I can make UI elements alive, but imagining and creating them is an art, which sadly I don't possess :( The website is currently live at rightaboutnow.com/
Also a student, trying to get into college to study what I love.

TypeScript > Javascript.

TDD > Faster MVP

Peace ✌️
